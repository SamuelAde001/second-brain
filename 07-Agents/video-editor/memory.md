## 2026-09-21 — The Resolve MCP bridge, proven

Verified live against Resolve **21.1**, project *"1. Taking a step back from Claude (and why you should too)"*.

- **Entry point is the `resolve` global.** Not `app.GetResolve()` — `app` is undefined in this sandbox. Start every script from `resolve`.
- **Sandbox is locked down:** `import os` (and other filesystem imports) is blocked — `PermissionError: import not allowed`. `import json` is fine. Do listing/filesystem work outside Resolve.
- **~10s hard limit per `run_script` call.** The **first Fusion operation of a session spins Fusion up and blows the limit** — it half-completed a `DuplicateTimeline` + `AddFusionComp` chain the first time. Fix: warm Fusion with a lone `AddFusionComp` (or any single Fusion call) first, then build in the next call. Keep each call small.
- **Duplicate a timeline** with `timeline.DuplicateTimeline("<name>")` → returns the new timeline. Non-destructive; it is the sanctioned "duplicate first" op. Then `project.SetCurrentTimeline(dup)`.
- **Fusion comp on a clip:** `timelineItem.AddFusionComp()` → a live FusionComp exposing the full Fusion tool API (`AddTool`, `FindTool`, `GetToolList`, `Lock`). `GetFusionCompByIndex(1)` re-fetches it.
- **Build nodes:** `comp.AddTool("<ToolID>", x, y)` — the `x, y` **are** the flow position (pass them here; `comp.CurrentFrame` is `nil` over the bridge, so `FlowView.SetPos` does **not** work). Tool IDs used: `RectangleMask`, `Background`, `TextPlus`, `Merge`.
- **Set values:** `tool.SetInput("Width", 0.5)` etc. — scalar inputs work directly. `TextPlus` uses `StyledText`, `Size`, `Red1/Green1/Blue1`. `Background` uses `TopLeftRed/Green/Blue`. Avoid Point-type inputs (e.g. mask `Center`) — leave them at the 0.5,0.5 default (already centred).
- **Name nodes:** `tool.SetAttrs({"TOOLS_Name": "Background_Fill_D01"})`.
- **Connect:** `dest.ConnectInput("EffectMask", maskTool)`, `merge.ConnectInput("Background", x)`, `merge.ConnectInput("Foreground", y)`, `MediaOut1.ConnectInput("Input", finalMerge)`.
- **`GetToolList()` returns a dict keyed by int** — iterate `.values()`, not the object directly.
- **Grab a still to show Samuel:** `timeline.SetCurrentTimecode(timeline.GetStartTimecode())` → `resolve.OpenPage("color")` → `still = timeline.GrabStill()` → `project.GetGallery().GetCurrentStillAlbum().ExportStills([still], out_dir, "prefix", "jpg")`. The still is **post-grade** — a heavy clip grade (blur/glow) will distort the card; say so, do not present it as the card's true look.
- **Courtesy:** restore Samuel's context at the end — `SetCurrentTimeline` back to his working timeline, `OpenPage("edit")`.

### The house-style card, built node-by-node (step-6 proof)
Bordered card = larger light RectangleMask→Background behind a smaller dark RectangleMask→Background, merged, text merged over, whole thing merged over `MediaIn1`, into `MediaOut1`. This **stacked-rect** border avoids the uncertain hollow-mask input IDs (`Solid`/`BorderWidth`) and is guaranteed to render. The **true house method** (Instance of the mask with `Solid=0`, `BorderWidth ~0.00184`, plus a NeoLightSweep Pro shine) is the fine-tuning layer Samuel adds — Fusion **Instance** tools and third-party macros (NeoLightSweep, NeoBevel, NeoAnim, NeoTextMotion, MosaicBlur) were **not** attempted over the bridge and remain unproven programmatically. Worked accent: border `#ff5a1f` = (1, 0.3529, 0.1216), fill = (0.1059, 0.0353, 0.0118).

## 2026-09-21 — Resolve 21 changed the HTML→Fusion picture
`get_whats_new since=20.0`: Resolve 21 (2026-06-03) added **native OGraf HTML graphics** and **native Lottie** on the Edit and Fusion pages, a **new Macro Editor** (publish Fusion macros to edit effects), **Krokodove + 100+ motion-graphics tools**, and new scripting APIs (timeline clip selection, get-timeline-from-mediapool-entry in 21.0.4, Speech Generator, IntelliSearch, speaker detection, disable-all-background-tasks). OGraf is a **preview** path only — it renders HTML, not editable nodes — so it does not replace step 6, but it may accelerate step 5. Test before relying on it.

## 2026-09-21 — Sync (SOP step 1) proven on real footage; ffmpeg installed

Test project **"Claude tests"** (Samuel's dedicated test project), footage at `C:\Users\repzy\Desktop\Video edits\Routerise\1. Taking a step back from Claude (and why you should too)\`.

- **`MediaPool.AutoSyncAudio(...AUDIO_SYNC_WAVEFORM)` returns `False` when the camera scratch audio is dead.** Verified: camera track −77.8 dB mean / no speech; mic −29.8 / −4.9. Both clip orders returned False. Treat `False` as "camera audio unusable → go to motion sync", not as a bug. Settings keys: `resolve.AUDIO_SYNC_MODE`, `AUDIO_SYNC_RETAIN_EMBEDDED_AUDIO`, `AUDIO_SYNC_CHANNEL_NUMBER`, `AUDIO_SYNC_RETAIN_VIDEO_METADATA`; modes `AUDIO_SYNC_WAVEFORM/TIMECODE/IN/OUT/MARKER`.
- **Motion-correlation fallback works:** video motion (ffmpeg `tblend=all_mode=difference`+`signalstats` YAVG @20Hz, `-hwaccel cuda`) × mic RMS envelope (@20Hz from `-ar 2000 -f s16le`), plain-Python FFT cross-correlation. Result **+4.000 s ≈ 120 frames @ 29.97, z = 7.6** — matches the SOP's prior ~4.17 s / 125 frames for this shoot. Script: `motion_sync2.py` in this session's scratchpad (fold into the `routerise-cut` skill). **Only the first 6 min needed** — the offset is one constant; align a section, the whole clip follows (Samuel's rule).
- **ffmpeg installed** 2026-09-21: Gyan build **9.0.1** via winget (`Gyan.FFmpeg`), at `C:\Users\repzy\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_..._8wekyb3d8bbwe\ffmpeg-9.0.1-full_build\bin\`. Not on the default shell PATH. **No ffmpeg/numpy/scipy before this**; stock Python 3.14 only. When the agent runs as a subagent, this media folder needs a grant in `.claude/settings.json` (AGENTS.md §10) — not granted yet.
- **Not yet done:** ear-check the +4.0 s on a timeline; decide how to *apply* the offset (media-pool linked audio vs. mic on A1 at the offset, per the SOP target: A-roll V1, mic A1 at +6 dB).

## Open, to verify next
- `ImportFusionComp(path)` with a Python-generated `.comp`/`.setting` file — his actual "paste `.setting`" method, automated. Not yet tested; would sidestep per-input datatype fiddliness.
- Whether NeoLightSweep Pro / the Neo* macros can be instantiated via `AddTool` or only via paste-from-`.setting`.
- A clean, un-graded render of a card (grab from a clip with no heavy grade, or render the Fusion output directly).
